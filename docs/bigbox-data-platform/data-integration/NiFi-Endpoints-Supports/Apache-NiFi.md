# Supported Apache NiFi Processors

Learn about the NiFi Processors supported by BigBox Support for use with BigAction.

Additional Processors are developed and tested by the BigBox community but are not officially supported by BigBox. Processors are excluded for a variety of reasons, including insufficient reliability or incomplete test case coverage, declaration of non-production readiness by the community at large, and feature deviation from BIgBox best practices. Do not use these features in your production environments.
