# Introduction

## Introduction

BigAction is software for automating and managing data flow between Apache Nifi based systems. Very reliable in processing and distributing data. It is easier to use because it provides a web-based User Interface to create, monitor and control data flow.

Several key terms must be understood.

FlowFile: Each piece of "User Data" (that is, data that a user brings in for processing and distribution) is referred to as a FlowFile. FlowFile consists of two parts: Attributes and Content. Content is User Data itself. Attributes are key-value pairs associated with User Data.

Processor: A processor is a NiFi component responsible for creating, sending, receiving, converting, routing, splitting, merging, and processing FlowFiles. It is the most critical building block for NiFi users to build data streams.
