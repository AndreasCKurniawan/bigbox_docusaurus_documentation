# Get More Info for Processor

With each Processor having the ability to expose several different properties and relationships, it can be difficult to remember how all the different parts work for each Processor. To work around this, we can right-click on Processor and select the Usage menu item. This will provide Processor usage information, such as Processor description, different relationships available, when different relationships were used, Properties exposed by Processor and its documentation, and FlowFile Attributes (if any).
