# Starting and Stopping the Processor

At this point, we have two Processors on the canvas, but nothing happens. To start the Processor, we can click on each one individually and then right-click and select the Start menu item. Alternatively, we can select the first Processor, then hold down the Shift key while selecting another Processor to select both. Then, we can right-click and select the Start menu item. As an alternative to using the context menu, we can select Processor and then click the Start icon in the Operate palette.

Once started, the icon in the upper left corner of the Processor will change from the stopped icon to the running icon. We can then stop the Processor by using the Stop icon in the Operate palette or the Stop menu item.

Once the Processor is started, we can't configure it anymore. On the other hand, when we right click on Processor, we are given the option to view the current configuration. In order to configure the Processor, we must first stop the Processor and wait for whatever task it might run to finish. The number of currently running tasks is shown near the top right corner of the Processor, but nothing is shown there if there are no tasks currently available.
