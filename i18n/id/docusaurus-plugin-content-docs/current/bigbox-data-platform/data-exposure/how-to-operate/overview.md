# Overview

BigEnvelope is a data exposure as a service solution that allows users to expose data sets from a data source into an API form that can be used by internal or external applications. In addition to the data source, BigEnvelope can also function as an API Gateway to other services so that it uses BigEnvelope's built-in access control features.

Broadly speaking, BigEnvelope consists of 3 components: Admin panel, API Backend, and monitoring dashboards.

### Admin Panel

The admin panel is a web application where admins can start building APIs from other data sources or services. In the admin panel, admins can register data sources, create APIs, register consumers and access each API.

### API Backend

API Backend is a service that will provide an API that has been created by the admin. The API Backend is in charge of processing API specifications that have been made by the admin into APIs that are ready to be used. It is the API Backend that will accept the API hit request from the consumer, execute the query if any, and return the appropriate response.

### Monitoring Dashboards

Monitoring dashboards are applications that monitor the performance of the APIs that have been created. Using monitoring dashboards, API performance measures such as latency, throughput, error rate, engine resource metrics, etc. can be monitored.

### Connection

On the connection page, admins can view data sources that have been registered on the BigEnvelope platform, as well as add, edit, or delete existing data sources.

### API

On the connection page, admin can see the API that has been generated by BigEnvelope. Admins can also add, edit, or delete existing APIs.

### Consumer

On the Consumer page, the admin can view registered Consumers and also set the IP address, rate limit, and access of the consumer to the API that has been generated.
